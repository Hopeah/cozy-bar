# [Cozy Bar](https://cozy-bar.netlify.app/)
Application that interacts with TheCocktailDB API to allow specific cocktail search. It utilizes MUI's autocomplete to enable easier cocktail searches and give you new ideas in the process. Cozy Bar also provides an ability to randomly pick a cocktail from over 600 different recipes to inspire you to try new drinks!

## Optimizations

Adding ability to save favorite recipes is next feature on the list to add to Cozy Bar. It would be also nice to provide users with an ability to easily share recipe page with others.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time working with MUI, and I have to admit while it was a lot of fun, it also took a couple hours of documentation searching to ensure autocomplete component is correctly setup with an API that varies based on the user input.
